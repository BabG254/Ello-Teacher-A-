# Ello-Teacher

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Ello Engineering Challenge, designed to showcase the ability to create a responsive and user-friendly UI using React and Material-UI. The project involves building a book assignment view for teachers, allowing them to search for books, add them to a reading list, and remove them as needed.

## Features

- **Search Books:** A search bar that allows users to search for books by title.
- **Book List:** Displays search results with book title, author, and a button to add the book to the reading list.
- **Reading List:** Displays all the books that the teacher has added to the reading list with an option to remove books.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Frontend framework used to build the UI.
- **Material-UI:** Component library for React to style the UI.
- **Apollo Client:** Used to fetch data from a GraphQL server.
- **GraphQL:** API query language used to fetch book data.

## Installation

A. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BabG254/Ello-Teacher-A-.git
   
B. HOW TO RUN- Really simple, just follow please.
You don't even need to run installations, I have embedded them there. Great right!?
Here are the steps:
1.  After cloning the repository.
2.  Navigate to the backend directory i.e. 'cd backend'
3.  Run 'npm start' on the terminal. It will give you this as output : http://localhost:4000/. Navigate to it on your browser, then press play on the books to load them.
   
   After all the above, just on the cloned project;
4. Open a different terminal and navigate to the frontend directory i.e. 'cd frontend'
5. Run 'npm start' on the terminal. Give it some time, it will load then this will be the output : http://localhost:3000/. It will open it for you but you can also navigate to it on your browser and see the frontend webview.


 As simple as that, so excited. ENJOY!
